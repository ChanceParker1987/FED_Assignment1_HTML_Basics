### Can I explain what my code does? ###
CSS from what I understand takes an HTML file and makes it "pretty". Making use of classes and tags I'm able to manipulate the colour, layout, position and sizing of all elements on the page.

### What was my coding process? ###
I started with a colour scheme and layout that I liked from the lab and I made it work for my online resume. I've never seen a resume look like this so I'm not sure it's appropriate, but I like the way it looks. I followed the instructions as best as I could but I'm pretty sure I still did somethings out of order. I think I probably forgot where I left off at some point during the assignment.

### What challenges did I have? ###
Most of the challenges I faced were due to the amount of branching with Git and GitHub. I've also been having trouble with my directory structure as well. My pushes to Github only sometimes go through and I have no idea why. I feel like it has something to do with the fact that I moved my files to my one drive so I could work on it after work, that may have been a mistake.

### What would I do differently now? ###
I definitely need to set up my directory structure better and not move it mid project. I'm going to set up the next one in one drive to begin with and see if that works because I need to be able to work on assignments at work. If not, I'll have to either keep it local on my laptop or on my PC.
