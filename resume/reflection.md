### Can I explain what my code does?
The first step for any project is to declare the Doctype, which in this case is HTML. I used the title tag to title the page and then followed the steps by section to add content to the page utilizing headers, unorganized lists and list items etc. I added section tags and ARIA roles as well as an SVG graphic.

### What was my coding process?
I mostly tried to follow the instructions step by step. However, I think I focused too much on the example resume as well as my own because I had to backtrack quite a bit. I think in the future I will try to plan my projects better so I won't have to do that as much.

### What challenges did I have?
Most of the challenges I faced were self-inflicted due to poor planning and lack of attention to detail on my part. I had to back track quite a bit in order to meet requirements that I misssed. I had to look up ARIA roles because I guess I missed what those were and how to implement them. I also had a decent amount of difficulty with the SVG graphic even with the help of AI.

### What would I do differently now?
I would definitely plan a little bit better and focus more on the requirements to make sure I don't miss anything intitially, as well as ensuring I know everything I need to know to complete the project beforehand so I don't have to stop in the middle to research things like ARIA roles. I
