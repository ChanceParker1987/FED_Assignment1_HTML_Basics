### Design Principles ###
My favorite colour is blue, so my selections reflect that.

1. Background-color: #D6EAF8 - This colour is mostly white but with a
subtle blue tint to it.

2. Block-color: #5DADE2 - This is an icy blue that I like, it will       provide the main block colour.

3. Font/Contrast colour: #154360 - This is a darker navy blue that will provide good contrast to the lighter blues for fonts and accents.

I'm not even sure if these are the same colours in the final product anymore, I had to change some things for contrast. I took a lot of inspiration from my lab because I really liked the way it looked. 

### Layout & Positioning ###
Still taking inspiration from the lab, not sure it's even appropriate for a resume but I think it's aesthetically pleasing. I'ts an improvement from the first iteration for sure.

### Custom Fonts ###
Not too much to say here, I chose Roboto because I thought it looked ok and it's a funny name. I tried to name the class "domoarigato" but it wouldn't let me for some reason.

### Responsive Design ###
I'm not even sure I did this part particularly well but my contact nav bar and skills items stack at least when viewed from mobile. I'm not a huge fan of how it looks but at least it still functions and is readable.

### Accessibility ###
This one was hard for me, I don't think I made it fully keyboard navigatable and my contrast ratio isn't quite there but I didn't want to change my whole colour scheme.
